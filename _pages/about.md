This is where I publish my research and fiction! Currently I work in English and Finnish in quite a haphazard manner, so there's not much to show on an English site. This will hopefully change soon.

My research interests are centered around emotions in fiction, antisocial essays and contemporary speculative fiction. Presumably my own fiction is affected by these interests, but other researchers could tell you better than I ever can.

Notes on site functionality
------
This site was created as a part of a course by Michael Schiltz in Hokkaido University. Many things still run on template or don't work at all; in future developments I'll be building the following things:
* language options to have the site in Finnish and English
* separation of fiction and science
* a sidebar better optimised for my purposes (I'm not big on social media).
