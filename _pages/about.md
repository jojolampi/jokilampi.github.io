This is where I publish my research and fiction! Currently I work in English and Finnish in quite a haphazard manner, so there's not much to show on an English site. This will hopefully change in the coming years.

My research interests are centered around emotions in fiction, antisocial essays and contemporary speculative fiction. Presumably my own fiction is affected by these interests, but other researchers could tell you better than I ever can.

Notes on site functionality
------
This site was created as a part of a course by Michael Schiltz in Hokkaido University. It should be mostly functional, with links leading to where they should and no major dead ends. I've removed a fair bit from the [original template](https://academicpages.github.io/), even though the site couldn't run without it. The sidebar has turned out to be a bit of a headache, but I still feel that the Academic Pages template is a very good one for my purposes for its aesthetics and ease of use.

I really don't know any coding, so a simple things like this site has been a grand learning journey.

In future developments I'll be building the following things:
* language options to have the site in Finnish and English
* separation of fiction and science
* a sidebar better optimised for my purposes (I'm not big on social media).
* removing the sidebar entirely on the Fiction page so you don't have to stare at my face as you read :)

I'm keeping the Guide page up for now because it is indeed very useful when I edit the side. I'll remove it eventually.
