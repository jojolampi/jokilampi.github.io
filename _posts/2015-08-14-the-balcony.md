This is the first short story I've written in English in a few years, and that shows. It still needs some editing towards the end for clarity, and perhaps a stronger crux to make it more evocative – right now it's an OK story, but it doesn't really stay with you, like a filler episode in a series. Still, I'm putting it here to show myself I'm allowed to publish imperfection.

A major strength in the story is that it sort of only has one real character in it, but it still manages to have a fair bit of events and shows of that characters personality, even when it shows no human-to-human interaction. For that, this was a good exercise.

The Balcony
======

In the rare idle summer days, Mama sat in the silence of her farmhouse balcony. She listened to the rustling woods, solved crossword puzzles, or dug through the pile of books left half-read on her nightstand. She rejoiced when parching hot midsummer days turned to rain that watered the flowers and ushered the crops to grow at their own pace. There was a lot of joy to be found when that was what you focused on.

Her house rose from the hill between a ridge and a lake, surrounded by a hedge fence that long since outgrew the younger trees. Mama's balcony was on the backside, with a view over the garden and the lake. The flowers she loved the most grew almost right below the balcony, still waiting to be planted from their pots. Rhododendron, echinacea, and others you've never heard of bloomed in their respective places, in a delicate system that seemed disorganized at first, but started to make sense once one stopped to look. After the flowers, basil and oregano and other herbs had spread from their vats to fill the lawn all the way to the crops: potato, broccoli, radish, swede, kale, and aubergine almost all the way to the lake. For years they had fed her family, with just enough to fill their cellar to brim. Of course, nowadays there was always way too much. The excess was more than she could feasibly gift to the neighbours she rarely met.

Mama had been hearing scratching and rattling noises from the balcony roof for some time, when the squirrel showed its face for the first time. It dashed up the log wall like a bouncing rocket and disappeared amongst the rafters. Soon it rushed back down again, only to return a few minutes later. Mama hollered, and the squirrel stopped on the balcony railing. 
"Hi there," Mama said. "I'm terribly sorry, but I think you should find another place for your nest. I really, really couldn't bear to share the balcony. I hope you understand."

Anyone who knew Mama would've found this most unusual – not her attempt to convey an argument to a squirrel, but the ungenerosity of her words. Under her reign, ants got to keep their hill next to the willow tree, and deer were half expected to eat the kale she still planted year after year. Mama didn't even mind getting her hands in fox scat most times she tended to the potatoes. But the balcony was different. It was her Place. 

"You can't just barge into my balcony uninvited", she explained. "If it's to be shared, it has to be done properly." Her family, she flinched at the thought, had understood this. With them, she'd had her peace. 

The squirrel didn't understand or care. It made the trip up and down a few times more, always carrying a twig or a nut in its mouth, until it finally collapsed on the railing to rest, eying Mama.
"You've got little ones up there, haven't you? You wouldn't be working so hard otherwise. I get that. I really do." She got up to look at her garden, the flowers, the herbs. The squirrel's gaze followed her under its thick brows. 
"You see, it's just that this is my Place. You and your family could never settle here fully, because it'd never feel your own." She looked the squirrel in the eye. It turned its head a little. 
"You understand, don't you? I've got the right to be selfish at this one little thing. And you've got the right to find your own Place."

The squirrel stood, scratching its tummy, and rushed down the wall once more. Mama sighed and tried to return to her crossword, as the squirrel made itself busy. It bounced through the yard and the field, avoiding open spots and spying the grounds from above. It dashed through flowerbeds and climbed every tree, professionally trying their bark with its claws. At the top the ant-housing willow it shook its fluffy tail and lunged down once more. Some time later it emerged from among the potato leaves and dashed up to the balcony roof. 

Mama soon saw it creeping down, slow and careful. In its mouth, it carried a young kit like a cat. Another kit, only slightly bigger, was testing the wall carefully with its half-formed claws. Mama smiled as she watched the squirrel show its pup where to place its claws, moving down the wall one gracious bounce at a time. All the while it kept the younger kit firmly in its mouth. Mama had never seen this before, yet it looked all too familiar.
The little one followed its mother diligently, mimicking its moves as best as it could with its shorter legs and smaller paws. It got to the edge of the railing, the last point of safety before the great chasm above the ground. Its mother was already on the ground, ushering the kit towards the cover of the potato leaves.

"I wonder if I'm the only mother in the world," Mama thought to herself, "who has convinced another to move her whole family to a new place with just a few words. Anyone I told would think me silly."

Lost in thought, she was too late to see the squirrel pup's second leap, its claws helplessly scratching against the logs. It didn't scream or squeak as it fell, making just the smallest cracking noise as it hit its neck to the side of an azalea pot. When Mama ran to the railing, she saw the pup motionless in the pot. Its head was twisted like an owl's.  
The small furry body was warm when Mama came down. She could feel the growing young muscles, the last heartbeats of blood pulsing through its veins. Still, life had escaped the kit’s eyes the moment its neck hit the corner of the pot. Its family was nowhere to be seen, but Mama knew the squirrel had seen what no mother should ever see.

"You stupid, stupid, stupid," Mama muttered to herself. "Of course, you had to have your stupid flowers here, when they would've been just as nice farther back. No, you had to see the azaleas from your dear personal balcony. Well, you have it all for yourself now. Enjoy."

Seething, she picked up the motionless corpse with her garden gloves and carried it to the stump of a lightning-felled oak between her balcony and the potatoes. Her garden shovel made a small grave, just enough for the little squirrel. Mama buried the pup alone. She moved the azaleas from their pot and planted them on the grave, even though she couldn't really see them from behind the stump.

Back at the balcony, she had a go at four different novels and swiftly gave up on each one. Sitting in her chair, eyes wide open, she pictured the squirrel's body, almost like it was asleep, just the head sickeningly twisted. Worse yet, when she closed her eyes, she saw another child, a mere thought of whom had brought her joy for years, until it all turned to grief. For just a few months now, she'd been able to fall asleep without first lying awake for hours, and to sleep without waking up in the dark, covered in sweat. Suddenly the unbearable months before were rushing back, quick and unstoppable like a squirrel on a log wall. 

"At least you still have the other one", Mama thought right before she fell to a restless sleep. If she'd heard herself, she wouldn't have been able to look in the mirror.
Mama woke up to the screams of a child. It wasn't much more than a squeak really, all the way from the yard. Still, blood escaped from her face to her feet, having her rush down from the balcony she'd fallen to restless sleep on, and dash through the moonless night before realising that of course it couldn't be who she'd thought of. Obviously, not anymore. 

Not that it mattered. The image of fox scat amongst the potato stalks was too clear in her mind. 

In the darkness, the crops seemed to go on forever. Somewhere among their endless green leaves she heard another squeak, more terrified than the last, and rushed towards it praying she wouldn't be too late.

"Get away! Away, you hear me!" Panting and shouting, Mama only saw the fox's tail as it disappeared towards the woods. It left behind a ball of fur and blood, curled under a leaf. Mama wailed as she knelt down and picked the tiny, maimed squirrel kit in her hands, ignoring all those warnings of mothers she herself had been uttering not too long ago. It wasn't moving or making a sound, but she could feel it shivering.

"It's okay", Mama whispered, her voice hoarse from the snot and tears she hadn't noticed until now. "It's okay, it's all okay. I'll take you home to your mother, okay? You'll be as safe as ever. I swear, I swear", she went on, as she carried the kit away from the half-finished makeshift nest. As they passed, she didn't notice a startled squirrel watching them from under the freshly planted azaleas.

At the balcony, Mama made a little nest out of baby clothes and stuffed animals that she should have thrown away long ago. The baby was hurt bad. It had scratches all over, and its left hind leg was barely connected to the rest of its body. 

"It was playing with you, you poor, poor thing." The baby was only half-conscious as she laid it down and patched up every single scratch, even stitched the leg as best as she could. When she got up, Mama saw the mother squirrel standing on the railing. It was staring at her once again, but this time she couldn't meet its eye.

"It's no use to say I'm sorry, is it? At best, I've given him a few more hours."
The squirrel looked on, motionless.
"Nothing I say can help you, but I didn't want this, you know. I just wanted my balcony."
She backed up a few steps and sat down in her favourite chair. It felt stiff. 

As soon as she was away, the squirrel ran to its kit. It sniffed at the wounds and touched the baby fur with its paws, made small squeaky noises and ran circles around the nest. The baby was too weak to move but didn't take its eyes off its mother. A few times it wailed meekly.

At last, the mother brought its snout to the kit's neck. It snuggled the soft fur and brought out its teeth. Carefully, it grabbed the kit by the bag of its neck, lifting it. Right away the baby started squirming again, making squeaks of pain and alarm. Its hind leg was dangling without control.

The kit fell silent as soon as its mother laid it back down. It ran to the railing above the flowerpots and turned to look at Mama. There was a demand in its unblinking eyes.
Mama realised what she didn't want to too fast. "No. Absolutely not. You couldn't yourself. I've done too much."

The kit had fallen silent. Its mother went to snuggle it with its snout once more, ever so softly. Then it rose to look at Mama a final time, turned around, and ran down the wall. 

Mama watched it go and kept staring at the darkness after it disappeared. She thought of her own mother. Even she'd gotten to call her Gran. Everyone had. Gran had always known what to do, even after her daughter had lost everything. Mama remembered the morning she'd tried to forget, when Gran had found her walking alongside the rapids. She'd been looking for a heavy enough stone to keep her down. Gran had brought her home with stern words and a soft voice.

"I thought I'd know too", Mama had said after resigning to her bed. "I thought when they were born, I'd become like you. That there was some magic that would tell me how to keep them safe."
"It has to look like magic to anyone else", Gran had said, "but really you just do as you feel is right and hope it's a good thing. It doesn’t help. You'll always demand more of yourself, even though you know you shouldn't. You just want them to never suffer, but you know they will. You'd do whatever to take their pain away. Even if you have to carry it as your own."

That's what I've lost, Mama had thought. The right to carry someone else's pain.

She was brought back by a thump. The kit had rolled out of its nest. Twitching on the floor, it was gasping for air. Like a scream without a sound. 
As Mama picked it up with trembling hands, she kept thinking of Gran. How the worst things turned good when she'd seen reason behind them. Carrying the kit to the edge of the balcony, she whispered comforting lies, how it would all be okay soon. She kept repeating Gran's words, not knowing if she was comforting the kit or herself, as she held it over the railing, right above the flowerpots. Whatever to take their pain away, she thought, as she let go.

A few days later, Mama sat in silence on their farmhouse balcony. She'd found the squirrel in its makeshift nest amongst the crops, where it had rubbed itself against splatters of blood and torn baby hairs. She'd carried it to the balcony, limp and unresisting, and laid in the nest of clothes and toys. Clutching a small furry animal with its paws, the squirrel was a sight as familiar it was as foreign. Every night it had run away, and every night Mama had brought it back. It never resisted. Mama no longer spoke. There was nothing to say, just the silence of their Place.
